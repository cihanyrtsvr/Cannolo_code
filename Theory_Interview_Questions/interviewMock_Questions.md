# Possible Interview Questions 

## 1- What is Object Oriented Programing (OOP) ?
Object orineted programing is  paradigm that organizes software around object, which bundles data(attributes) and behavoir(methods) together, modeling real world things like cars or users for making code modular anbd re-usable and easier to maintain by defining bluprints (classes) for creating many similar objects. 
 Key concepts are;
 * Classes (blueprints); definition of concept or template for a concept.It describes 2 things(called blueprint since ir is a set of isntructions)
    - What object contains(DAta/Properties) --> Member variables
    - What object can do(Behavoir) --> Member Functions(methods)
 * Objects(instances); Instance of a class. 
    - When the object creaate the program allocates a memory to hold the spesific data defined in class. 
    - All object has their own value but they share thir method(behavoir)
 * Encapsulation(hiding data); 
    - Which protects data inside the object so it cant be corrupted by outside code 
 * Inheretance (reusing code)
  - Which lets us create the classes based on the exsiting one to avoid writing repetitive code. 
 * Polymorphism(shared behavoir, different forms) 
    - Allows different objects built from different blueprint, to repsond tot he same command in their own way. The shared, general fucntion is frist defineed in a base class usinf virtual keyword
 * Abstraction 
    - which hides complex implementation details and only exposes what is necessary to user.
