# Unknown Notes
**Abstract classes CAN NOT initiate objects** since they used as base class. 
The classes that are been used to instantiate classes called ***concrete** classes.

* virtual void draw() const = 0; this is an example of pure class. 
_Question; Does class also provies the plugin properties as when we destruct we can have the system function same as work?_

_Question; What is abstract class?_


For GNU C++, open a shell and change to the directory containing all the files for
a given program, then execute the following command:
''' shell
g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -o ExecutableName
'''

*Important;* The constructor shoul dbe non-static but it self can initialize const object.

**IMPORTANT:** When we use member initializer the derived classes since it willl show us how the protected and derived class can be effectred from that. 

* We use inheretence to avoid re-usage of the code and create some links (is-has) links for the classes.
* To avoid suplication and increasing the error use inheritance.
* In this way when teh changes required it can be changed by only from the base class easier to manage.

**In Class, there is a class definition function and class member function 
    * The member function is an .cpp file but the definition function is an .h
An alternative to #ifndef-#define we can use #pragma once
